# ai-skills

This repo stores local AI skills. Each skill lives in its own folder under `skills/`.

## Structure

- `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` is the entry point and instructions for the skill.

## Naming

- Prefer kebab-case for skill folder names (e.g., `data-cleaning`, `repo-review`).
- Keep skill folders self-contained (templates, scripts, references live alongside the `SKILL.md`).
